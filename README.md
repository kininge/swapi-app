## ⚠️ API Limitations & Design Solutions

The [SWAPI.tech](https://swapi.tech) API offers rich Star Wars data — but building a scalable, performant, and user-friendly application required working around some notable limitations.

---

### 1. `/people` vs `/people?expanded=true`

> The base `/people` endpoint returns only minimal character data.  
> While `?expanded=true` adds more fields (skin_color, hair_color, height, eye_color, mass, birth_year etc.), it still omits **planet information**.

**🛠️ Solution**:  
- Defaulted to `/people?expanded=true` for enhanced detail  
- Homeworld (planet) data is **fetched lazily**, only when a character card becomes visible  
- Planet responses are **cached and persisted**, reducing network calls across device (browser)

---

### 2. Missing relationships to films & starships

> The `/people` endpoint provides **no direct connection** to films or starships.  
> Instead:
> - Films reference character URLs  
> - Starships reference pilot(character) URLs

**🛠️ Solution**:  
- At app boot, we **fetch all films and starships once**  
- Build **reverse maps**:
  - `characterToFilms`
  - `characterToStarships`  
- Enables fast, relational lookups for character detail pages with **no repeated network calls**

---

### 3. No support for editing or saving favorites

> SWAPI is read-only — it doesn’t support mutations or user-specific storage.

**🛠️ Solution**:  
- **Edit Feature**: Editable fields (gender, height, etc.) are stored locally per character ID  
- **Favorites Feature**: Mark/unmark characters as favorites using local persisted state  
- These behave like real app features, despite no backend support

---

### 4. Non-paginated search results

> The search endpoint returns large result sets (e.g., 57 results for `"a"`) **without pagination**

**🛠️ Solution**:  
- Used `react-window` + `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` to **virtualize long lists**  
- Ensures fast rendering and smooth UX regardless of result size

---

### ✅ Summary

Despite these API limitations, we built a fully-featured, production-quality app by:

- Designing a **robust cache-first architecture**
- Using **smart, preemptive fetching and reverse mapping**
- Simulating real-world functionality (favorites, edits) with local strategies
- Prioritizing **performance and UX** with caching, virtualization and lazy loading

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Developer Docs

This app follows a **cache-first, offline-ready architecture** designed to minimize API calls and support scalable micro-frontend growth.

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/architecture/swapi-architecture.png)

---

### 💡 Why Cache-First?

This app is designed as **offline-friendly and cache-prioritized** — aligned with the reality of the [SWAPI.tech](https://swapi.tech) API and the usage expectations of a character browsing tool.

#### ⚖️ CAP Tradeoff
In distributed system terms (CAP theorem), we **intentionally prioritize _Availability_ and _Partition Tolerance_** over strict **Consistency**. That’s because:

- The data is *mostly static* (fictional universe, no real-time updates)
- Stale data is acceptable for the user experience
- Network latency or API downtime should not break the core UI

#### ✅ Results:
- Characters, films, starships, and planet data are cached
- API calls are deduplicated aggressively
- Redux Persist ensures long-term caching until manually cleared

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

This app was built using a **TDD-first mindset** with both unit and integration tests.

### ✅ Unit Testing (Jest + RTL)
- Component render logic
- Redux slices (favorites, cache)
- Utility functions (e.g., deduplication)

### 🔍 Integration Testing (Cypress)
- Virtualized character list scrolling
- Navigation from character list → detail page
- Favorite toggle interaction
- Inline edit workflow and verification

> Cypress uses `data-character-id` to track virtualized list items and ensure correctness.

### ⚙️ MSW
Mock Service Worker (MSW) was considered for full API mocking, but skipped due to persistent issues with:
- `BroadcastChannel` and `TransformStream` polyfills in Node 20+
- JSDOM limitations

Instead, **we mock RTK Query hooks in unit tests using Jest**.

---

### 📦 Test Commands

```bash
   # Run all unit tests
   yarn test

   # unit tests + Check coverage <---- recommend
   yarn test:coverage

   # Open Cypress UI
   yarn cy:open

   # Run Cypress heedlessly <---- recommend
   yarn cy:run
```

## 🧠 Architecture & Design Decisions

This app is built with performance, scalability, and offline-readiness in mind:

- ⚙️ **RTK Query** for auto-cached, scalable data fetching
- 💾 **Redux Persist** to preserve cache, favorites, and edits across reloads
- 🚀 **Boot-time preload** of global entities (films, starships), with reverse mappings to characters
- 🌀 **Virtualized scroll** (`react-window`) for smooth rendering of large lists
- 🚫 **Component-level deduplication** to prevent duplicated characters
- 🔍 **Decoupled Search Page** avoids unnecessary pagination logic
- ❤️ **Favorites & Edits** stored in normalized maps (`{ [id]: data }`) for quick access
- 🧪 **TDD-first** development: unit + integration test coverage from day one
